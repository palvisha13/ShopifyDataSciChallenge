## Shopify Data Science Internship Challenge Summer 2022

This is my submission with my analysis included, for the Shopify data science challenge.

### Question 1

a. The AOV amount provided in the question is $3145.13. The AOV is calculated by taking the total revenue and dividing by the total number of orders. The reason that this  AOV calculation is much higher than the expected cost of shoes is because it is  the _average cost of orders_, not the  _average cost of shoes_. The AOV does not account for the total number of shoes purchased. Instead, it only considers the total cost of orders, divided by the total number of orders (5000 orders). Given that the highest order total is $704 000 (definitely closer to being the price of a house than a shoe), the AOV is highly skewed due to this data point, making it much greater than the general cost of shoes.
