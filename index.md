## Shopify Data Science Internship Challenge Summer 2022

This is my submission with my analysis included, for the Shopify data science challenge.

### Question 1

The problem with the average calculated is that it does not account for the total number of each shoe. The average calculated is simply the average of the values in the `order_amount` column.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/palvisha13/ShopifyDataSciChallenge/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
